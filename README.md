# pyCNC
### i know the code it a mess but it works rn , ill make better edits and beautify the code when it needs it

### This is a weird project im working on that will pretty much be just a secure cnc server and client built on a simple flask api with many features like some basic administration and some funnys ;) This will basicly be Reasonable Demands (my old cnc) on crack and easier for someone to add their own additions.
